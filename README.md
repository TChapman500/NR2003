# NR2003
This is an attempt at making NR2003 open source for the purposes of (a) recompiling to 64-bit to extend lifetime, (b) make it eaiser to use modern hardware features such as AVX, DX11, etc., and (c) increasing its modability.  The non-source files are [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) project files.
